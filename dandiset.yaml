description: "In these recordings, we tested different PRFs (pulse repetition frequencies)
  of ultrasound stimulation using a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer
  to stimulate the somatosensory cortex of awake head-fixed rats. Chronic electrophysiological
  recordings were acquired using 32-channel NeuroNexus electrodes (Model: A1x32-Poly3-10mm-50-177-Z32),
  chronically implanted into the rat brain. Ultrasound stimulation is delivered every
  2.5 seconds with a 10% jitter, and each recording has 500 trials. The PRFs tested
  were 30 Hz, 300 Hz, 1500 Hz, 3000 Hz, and 4500 Hz, each with a 200 microsecond pulse
  duration and a 67 ms ultrasound duration. Anesthetized files were performed under
  2% isoflurane anesthesia for comparison.\n\nFile Information\nAll 10 subjects were
  male rats, implanted with their chronic electrode at 6 months of age and then recordings
  taken first at 8-10 months, and then some repeats taken at 12 months. Within each
  subject's folder are recordings for the different PRFs. Most subjects have 5 recordings
  within, one for each PRF. Some subjects have duplicate recordings taken a few months
  after the original ones. A few recordings were not included due to excessive noise
  in the recordings. Files are named in the format SubjectName_PRF_PulseDuration.
  Each file contains spike time data with the cell type labels included for each neurons,
  as well as time series data for the onset of each trial of ultrasound stimulation."
